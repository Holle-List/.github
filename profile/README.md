## Current works

- Digitalising the whole Holle List volumes via the Tesseract software:

    - We are done digitalising the entire volumes of vol. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10/3 (for [the Barrier Islands Languages](https://github.com/complexico/holle-list-barrier-islands), off the west coast of Sumatra)
    
    - We are left to digitalise the last volume (volume 11) and several languages in the Sumatra area

- Proofreading and editing the digitalisation results
